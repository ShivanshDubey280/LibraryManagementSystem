# LibraryManagementSystem
 the Library Management System provides an efficient solution for managing books and students in libraries. Its user-friendly interface, along with features such as book addition, issuing, returning, and data storage, simplifies the overall management process.


Description:
The Library Management System is a software program designed to efficiently manage the operations of a library. It provides a user-friendly interface for librarians to handle tasks such as adding books, adding students, issuing books to students, and returning books. The system also incorporates data persistence by saving and loading data from text files.

Key Features:

Add Book: Librarians can add new books to the library by providing details such as the book's name and author. The added books are stored in the system for future reference.

Add Student: Librarians can register new students by entering their names. The system maintains a list of registered students.

Display Books: The system displays a list of all books available in the library, including their names, authors, availability status, issue dates, and return dates. This feature allows librarians to quickly check the status of each book.

Display Students: Librarians can view a list of all registered students and the books issued to each student. This feature helps in keeping track of the books borrowed by students.

Issue Book: Librarians can issue books to students by specifying the book name and the student's name. The system checks the availability of the book and records the issue date. If the book is available, it is marked as issued and assigned to the student.

Return Book: When a student returns a book, librarians can use this feature to update the book's status and mark it as available again. The system records the return date and removes the association between the student and the book.

Save Data: The system provides an option to save all the book and student data to text files. This ensures that the data is preserved even after the program is closed and can be loaded in subsequent sessions.

The Library Management System streamlines the day-to-day operations of a library, making it easier for librarians to manage books, students, and the borrowing process. It offers efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information. With its user-friendly interface, the system simplifies library management tasks, ultimately improving the overall library experience for both librarians and students.
